Added:
= landscape and portrait fragments
In progress:
= video demonstrations

Have to redo the files, OpenCV wouldn't initialize and I didn't catch it early enough.
Luckily there's not that much to rebuild.
1952H: Brought code back to original state.

Setback, VideoWriter doesn't work (supposedly) on Android just yet, will link the
StackOverflow thread about it later. Will have to read bytes into buffer into image
and repeat per frame.

Errors: VideoDemonstrations.java, can't open VideoWriter

USB connection between Android and Arduino functional.

Errors: UI can't switch from BotConnect and VideoDemonstrations, changes after
        choosing one or the other

Connected Android to Arduino Uno (Iduino Uno) via USB

Removing VideoDemonstrations and connected classes. Those will be moved to a Python
program instead. Also fixed phone orientation to landscape. It's harder to balance a
phone using portrait view.

Camera successfully accessed using Camera2 hardware.

Finally got the preview set to 1280x720 and I understand how I got there. My relief
is endless, my delight immeasurable.

7/6/2023
Made version 2.0 due to changes in Gradle that kept OpenCV from making a BuildConfig.java and
R files that were needed. Got around this by disabling kotlin-android and making my own BuildConfig
file. Hopefully this isn't game-breaking later on.

It works. It finally installed properly. My heart is full.

Relevant code:

=====build.gradle (:opencv)=====
// for generating a BuildConfig and reading interfaces in aidl files
buildFeatures {
        aidl true
        buildConfig true
}

//res.srcDirs has to be rerouted to opencv's res folder
sourceSets {
    main {
        jniLibs.srcDirs = ['native/libs']
        java.srcDirs = ['java/src']
        aidl.srcDirs = ['java/src/org/opencv/engine']
        res.srcDirs = ['res']
        manifest.srcFile 'java/AndroidManifest.xml'
    }
}

=====AndroidManifest.xml (:opencv)=====

// new way of adding the package name in xml files. "package=<name>"
// has been deprecated
xmlns:opencv="org.opencv"
