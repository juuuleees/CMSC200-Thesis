- code won't convert video to grayscale, possibly issues with filepath
- error: (-215:Assertion failed) frameSize.width > 0 && frameSize.height > 0 in function 'open'
	= means that for some reason it doesn't read a frame/image, yet it
		produces the necessary output

- resolved grayscale conversion issue with VideoFileclip from moviepy, code refactored for
	further moviepy usage
	1805H
		- MoviePy error: failed to read the duration of file output_videos/fov_video.mp4.
			This has to be handled even though it produces the file we need. Not the 
			greatest priority but it has to be solved before/during file selection implementation
			Oddly it only occurs when assigning a new VideoFileClip to self.fov_video.
			
			Solution: remove that variable. It writes the video we need, anyway. But put a pin
			in this error, I get the feeling it'll come back.
	1828H:
		- fov_video.mp4 isn't being written properly somehow. It's playable and everything but
			you can't get its duration which is messing with the rest of the code.

0023H:
	- video is now being written correctly. Relief.
2048H:
	- markFeatures() causes a segfault and doesn't write to video properly. However locating features
		works fine and results are visible using cv2.imshow()
