Have to redo the files, OpenCV wouldn't initialize and I didn't catch it early enough.
Luckily there's not that much to rebuild.
1952H: Brought code back to original state.

Setback, VideoWriter doesn't work (supposedly) on Android just yet, will link the
StackOverflow thread about it later. Will have to read bytes into buffer into image
and repeat per frame.

Errors: VideoDemonstrations.java, can't open VideoWriter

USB connection between Android and Arduino functional.

Errors: UI can't switch from BotConnect and VideoDemonstrations, changes after
        choosing one or the other

Connected Android to Arduino Uno (Iduino Uno) via USB

Removing VideoDemonstrations and connected classes. Those will be moved to a Python
program instead. Also fixed phone orientation to landscape. It's harder to balance a
phone using portrait view.
